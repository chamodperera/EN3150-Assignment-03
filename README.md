# Waste Classification (RealWaste)

## 1) Project Introduction

This repository contains our coursework implementation for *EN3150 – Learning from Data. The goal is to build and evaluate image classifiers for the **RealWaste* dataset (9 classes; real‑world landfill images) and to compare a *custom CNN trained from scratch* against *transfer‑learning* baselines.

### Why this project?

RealWaste classification supports practical recycling workflows by automatically identifying material categories such as Cardboard, Paper, Plastic, Metal, Glass, Food Organics, Textile Trash, Vegetation, and Miscellaneous Trash. The dataset is moderately sized and imbalanced, making it a good testbed for modern training practices (augmentation, schedulers, early stopping) and for leveraging pre‑trained vision backbones.
